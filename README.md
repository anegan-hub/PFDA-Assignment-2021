<br>

The following assignment concerns the **numpy.random package** in Python. 
I am required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in my Jupyter notebook.

<br>

-  Explain the overall purpose of the package.
-  Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
-  Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
-  Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

***

## Packages Required

- Anaconda 
- Cmder(Windows)

Once both packages are downloaded run 'jupyter lab' on cmder to open jupyter notebook. 

***

## Contents

- Images Folder ( images used)
- numpy.randon.ipynb (Jupyter notebook)
- requirements.txt (required if using binder)
- .gitignore file
